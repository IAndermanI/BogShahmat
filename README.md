Chess engine from IAndermanI. 
Disclaimer: this chess engine works only on console and takes input from it. Beacuse of some techical issues (pext and pdep), it works only on Windows Ñ…86-64.
Input format: at first, program will ask you to input your piece's color ("white" or "black"). Then, the game starts. When it is your turn, machine expects you to print move and depth. Move format: 'square1''square2''promoted_piece (if any)', for example: e2e4 or h2h1Q (a pwan promoted to the queen). When there is the turn of program, it will think and then print the best move and the best line.
What will be added: for now program for testing is on development, also debut base and better evaluation will be soon.
